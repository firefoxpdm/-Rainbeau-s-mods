I was using some of Rainbeau's mods, so I decided to (try and) migrate them to 1.1. Preferably all of them, but that is already proven to be difficult.

Here you can see the progress.

**Advanced Bridges** -- Done at https://github.com/firefoxpdm/Rainbeau-s-Advanced-Bridges/releases/latest

**Archipelagos** -- Done at https://github.com/firefoxpdm/Rainbeau-s-Archipelagos/releases/latest

**Concrete** -- Done* at https://github.com/firefoxpdm/Rainbeau-s-Concrete/releases/latest

**Editable Backstories and Names** -- I had a look, but the whole character generation has changed a lot. I would rather go for the simpler mods first, and come back to this later if I can.

**Etched Stone Walls** -- Done* at https://github.com/firefoxpdm/Rainbeau-s-Etched-Stone-Walls/releases/latest

**Fertile Fields** -- Done* at https://github.com/firefoxpdm/Rainbeau-s-Fertile-Fields/releases/latest

If you find some issues with them, please open a ticket. Since I am not the creator, it is unlikely that I can provide any new features.

The entries marked with a * are waiting for a final code cleanup.
