I was using some of Rainbeau's mods, so I decided to (try and) migrate them to 1.1. Preferably all of them, but that is already proven to be difficult.

Here you can see the progress.

**Advanced Bridges** – Done at https://github.com/firefoxpdm/Rainbeau-s-Advanced-Bridges/releases/latest

**Archipelagos** – Done at https://github.com/firefoxpdm/Rainbeau-s-Archipelagos/releases/latest

**Concrete** – Done* at https://github.com/firefoxpdm/Rainbeau-s-Concrete/releases/latest

**Editable Backstories and Names** – I had a look, but the whole character generation has changed a lot. I would rather go for the simpler mods first, and come back to this later if I can.

**Etched Stone Walls** – Done* at https://github.com/firefoxpdm/Rainbeau-s-Etched-Stone-Walls/releases/latest

**Fertile Fields** – Done* at https://github.com/firefoxpdm/Rainbeau-s-Fertile-Fields/releases/latest

**Fishing** – Done* at https://github.com/firefoxpdm/Rainbeau-s-Fishing/releases/latest

**Packed Lunches** – Done at https://github.com/firefoxpdm/Rainbeau-s-Packed-Lunches/releases/latest

**Pawns Are Capable!** – Done* at https://github.com/firefoxpdm/Rainbeau-s-Pawns-are-Capable/releases/latest

**Permafrost** – Done* at https://github.com/firefoxpdm/Rainbeau-s-Permafrost/releases/latest

**Rainbeau Flambe - Storyteller** – Done at https://github.com/firefoxpdm/Rainbeau-Flambe---Storyteller/releases/latest Some configurations has changed between 1.0 and 1.1, in these cases I tried to pick the settings that resembled the original ones the closest. Check the release notes for the technicalities.

**Rational Romance** – Done* at https://github.com/firefoxpdm/Rainbeau-s-Rational-Romance/

**Realistic Planets** – Done* at https://github.com/firefoxpdm/Rainbeau-s-Realistic-Planets/releases/latest

**Rim Disorders** – Done* at https://github.com/firefoxpdm/Rainbeau-s-Rim-Disorders/releases/latest

**Rumor Has It** –  Done* at https://github.com/firefoxpdm/Rainbeau-s-Rumor-Has-It/releases/latest

**Scenarios** – Done* at https://github.com/firefoxpdm/Rainbeau-s-Scenarios/releases/latest

**Tribal Pawn Names** – Done* at https://github.com/firefoxpdm/Rainbeau-s-Tribal-Pawn-Names/releases/latest

**Tribal Raiders** – A pre-release version is available at https://github.com/firefoxpdm/Rainbeau-s-Tribal-Raiders/releases/tag/v1.1.0 This mod contains new backstories for raiders, the handling of which has changed between 1.0 and 1.1. It has the same problems as the editable backstories and names mod. However, since here this feels just like an additional thing instead of the main functionality, I have decided to remove them (the backstories) to provide a first draft, and will revisit it once I figure out how they can be integrated into 1.1. You will also see error messages pop up along the lines of "No shuffled Childhood found for archer chief of TribalRaiders. Choosing random.". These should be safe to ignore.

**Wild Cultivation** – Done* at https://github.com/firefoxpdm/Rainbeau-s-Wild-Cultivation/releases/latest

If you find some issues with them, please open a ticket. Since I am not the creator, it is unlikely that I can provide any new features.

The entries marked with a * are waiting for a final code cleanup.
