I was using some of Rainbeau's mods, so I decided to (try and) migrate them to 1.1. Preferably all of them, but that is already proven to be difficult.

Here you can see the progress.

**Advanced Bridges** -- Done at https://github.com/firefoxpdm/Rainbeau-s-Advanced-Bridges

**Archipelagos** -- Done at https://github.com/firefoxpdm/Rainbeau-s-Archipelagos

**Concrete**

**Editable Backstories and Names** - I had a look, but the whole character generation has changed a lot. I would rather go for the simpler mods first, and come back to this later if I can.

**Etched Stone Walls**

**Fertile Fields**

**Fishing** -- Done at https://github.com/firefoxpdm/Rainbeau-s-Fishing although I want to do some cleanup on this.

**Packed Lunches**

**Pawns Are Capable!**

**Permafrost**

**Rainbeau Flambe - Storyteller**

**Rational Romance**

**Realistic Planets**

**Rim Disorders**

**Rumor Has It**

**Scenarios**

**Tribal Pawn Names**

**Tribal Raiders**

**Wild Cultivation**

If you find some issues with them, please open a ticket. Since I am not the creator, it is unlikely that I can provide any new features.
